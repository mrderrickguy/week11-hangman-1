# week11-hangman
An Updated Hangman App Using Constructors and Node.js

# Assignment
We were tasked with recreating out Hangman game that we had created much earlier on in the class, only this time we were to use node.js and our recently learned concepts of constructors. We were also to use exports and spread our JS across multiple files so that we could practice accessing functions and variables within another file.

# New Technologies/Concepts Introduced
* inquirer.js
	- inquirer.js is a JavaScript library that allows us to use the CLI as a prompt for the user. This is how we are able to post questions and have the user respond back within their terminal/command prompt.
* Constructors
	- Constructors were this weeks focus during our lessons. We used them in class to create objects and then use those objects within a game that involved teamwork. In this exercise, we were to use constructors to play hangman. 
* Exports/Require
	- Exports/require were new concepts to me at this point in the course. We used them to be able to access variables and functions that we otherwise would not have been able to access within the other JS files. 

# Challenges
This exercise proved to be very challenging! I am currently unable to figure out how to use constructors properly in this game. The game is mostly functioning without a constructor however, I will figure this out!
